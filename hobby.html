				In an era that everyone who holds a camera will be called a photographer, photography has more and more enthusiasts. Every day we can enjoy millions of photos scattered on social media, especially on Instagram. Beautiful images from people who choose photography as a hobby, to spectacular works from a professional photographer in different styles or genres of photography. Starting from architectural, candid, documentary, fashion, food, landscape, night-long exposure, photojournalism, portraiture, sport, street, wildlife, aerial to fine art photography. From black and white to color, photography remains a beautiful work for its lovers.
				<br>
				<br>Since I love photography, I appreciate every moment of my life and my surroundings more. Moments when I travel, meet friends, and vacation with family—I capture every moment that will be a beautiful memory to remember. I also pay more attention to the moment around me, natural moments like sunrises, sunsets, fog, and rain. I also like to capture more moments of people's lives, especially for moments that can't be repeated like moments of cultural events and the moment of the cremation ceremony in Bali.
                <br>
				<br>Photography makes me think of more creative concepts and rich ideas. It's an image that has a visual appeal and can be understood even without words. How to make photos that can attract readers, touch their hearts and minds to support my writing as a writer, so I have to understand photography—although I didn't ever take formal photography lessons.
