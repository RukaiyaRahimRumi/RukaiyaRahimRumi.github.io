			<h1 style="float: left;">Why did you choose to study CSE?</h1>
			<p style="float: left;">The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving,an essential skill for life.Students study the design,devolopment and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business,scientific and social contexts.Because computers solve problems to serve people,there is a significant human side to computer science as well.
			Recnt computer science graduates work at dozens of companies including Amazon,Google,Apple,Microsoft etc.
			So I know this may sound like the typical lame "follow your passion"advive.But if you study something you like,you will be good at it.If you are good at something,you will likely be succesful at it and can probably make a living at it.</p>
